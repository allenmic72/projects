========

Some code for projects I am currently working on. Feel free to browse or attempt to run.

  -ImageMatching uses a keypoint detection algorithm to perform image matching. This is a work in progress.
  
  
  -NUMAD-MichaelAllen is an android app which contains Boggle and Sudoku. I did not write the code for Sudoku, 
      credit goes to the textbook Hello, Android.
      This app is a work in progress, but Boggle is functional and new features will be added to it shortly.
