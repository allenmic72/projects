Some code for projects I am currently working on. Feel free to browse or attempt to run

  ImageMatching uses a keypoint detection algorithm to perform image matching. This is a work in progress
  NUMAD-MichaelAllen is an android app which contains Boggle and Sudoku. I did not write the code for Sudoku, 
    credit goes to the textbook Hello, Android
    This app is a work in progress, but Boggle is functional and new features will be added to it shortly
